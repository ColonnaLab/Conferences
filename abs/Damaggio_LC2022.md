Huntington’s disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive involuntary choreiform movements, behavioral, cognitive and psychiatric disturbances. The mean age of onset is 35 to 44 years, and the median survival time is 15 to 18 years after onset. HD occurs worldwide and has a prevalence of   ̴12 per 100’000 people of European ancestry.

HD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and it is caused by CAG repeat expansion in the exon 1 of huntingtin gene (HTT) which leads the production of mutant HTT protein with an elongated polyglutamine stretch.

The CAG repeat is somatically and meiotically unstable, progressively lengthens throughout life and tends to expand among generations. CAG expansions occur in dividing cells other than in post-mitotic neurons and may continue during lifetime of the individual generating a mosaic of cells with different repeat lengths, reaching over 1000 CAG repetitions as observed in striatal and cortical brain areas of HD post-mortem human samples.

A significant inverse correlation exists between the number of CAG repeats and the age of onset of HD-related motor symptoms. Moreover, the purity of the repeat - whether it is perfect or interrupted by point substitutions or other codons - also influences its stability.  The most common CAG repeat tract (>95% of alleles) has a CAA interruption in the penultimate repeat [(CAG)n-CAA-CAG]. Uninterrupted CAG repeats [(CAG)n] are associated with decreased age of onset in HD and increased somatic instability of the repeat.

The development of an efficient and accurate CAG sizing procedure for the identification of cis- genetic factors that are implicated in HTT CAG instability, both during mitotic cell replication and in post-mitotic neurons, is urgent.

We developed a human embryonic stem cell platform carrying different CAG repeats to study alterations on CAG size in proliferation and in post-mitotic neurons. We are taking advantage on Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) which allows us to cover the full HTT-modified locus with an accuracy ~ 95 % with the latest sequencing chemistry released by ONT.

CAG size and modifications are evaluated using Straglr and the distribution of the counts showed as an adjusted instability index that refers to the own intrinsic instability of each cell line analyzed at day 0.

Thanks to this approach we are having the possibility to precisely detect a perturbation of CAG stability depending on CAG length in proliferative cells.
